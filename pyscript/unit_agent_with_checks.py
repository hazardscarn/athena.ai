    Create a plan for month {current_month} that helps the user progress towards their 1-year goal while addressing their 
    challenges and keeping their ultimate aspiration in mind. The plan should include a theme and 3-5 specific, actionable tasks.

    Incorporate the suggestions for improvement in your plan. Ensure that the new plan addresses any issues raised in the suggestions.

    Guidelines that should be followed while creating the plan:
                 
        - Tasks must be relevant to the user's field of work, career goals, and the month's theme.
        - Tasks should be achievable within the month, specific, measurable, and time-bound.
        - Tasks must be actionable and help the user build skills, knowledge, or experience.
        - Ensure the theme and tasks follow the sequence/continuation of previous months' plans, if any.
        - Try to avoid repetitive themes and tasks.
        - It is mandatory to have a theme specified for the month. If no theme can be generated for month, generate a them summarizing the tasks.
        - It is mandatory that atleast one of the tasks in a month will be providing new learning or skill development for the user. It could be a course, a book, a project, a certification, etc.
        - Each task should have an expected time frame for completion (1-4 weeks max).
        - Do not add more than 1000 words in a single task. Make sure the tasks are under 1000 words each max.
        - Make sure all the tasks have an expected time frame for completion.
        - The total tasks for a month should be achievable and not overwhelming.
        - "No theme specified" is not a valid theme.

    Use the following format for plan output:

    Theme: [Month's theme]

    Tasks:
    1. **[Task 1 Title]**
    [Task 1 Description]
    (Expected time frame: X weeks)

    2. **[Task 2 Title]**
    [Task 2 Description]
    (Expected time frame: X weeks)

    3. **[Task 3 Title]**
    [Task 3 Description]
    (Expected time frame: X weeks)

    4. **[Task 4 Title]** (optional)
    [Task 4 Description]
    (Expected time frame: X weeks)
             
    Ensure that your output follows this format and adheres to all the guidelines provided.
